// It first refuses when no CLI can be located at all. The provider is a toggle,
// so switching it on in settings credentials it whether or not claude is
// installed; counted as available, a missing CLI would win the default model,
// keep the setup wizard away, and fail every turn. This is no fail-closed probe:
// the lookup is a stat, re-run on every refresh (claudeBinary re-resolves
// whenever it holds no runnable path), so an install or a path set in settings re-enables the
// provider on the next refresh.
//
// Beyond that it refuses on one signal only: a real turn that failed to
// authenticate. The probe is never allowed to disable the provider, because
// `claude auth status` has been observed reporting "loggedIn": true in a context where a turn had
// just taken a genuine 401, and reporting false where an interactive login was
// working fine. A wrong answer in that direction takes away the user's only way
// of working.

// While expired, the probe runs — throttled — and can only ever RE-ENABLE. It
// clears the expiry when it says signed in, and equally when it cannot answer at
// all. That second case is not laziness: an old CLI has no `auth status`, and if
// only a successful turn could clear the expiry, a provider we had disabled
// could never be re-enabled by one. Letting the turn through means the worst
// case is the same error again, reported properly, instead of a dead end.
