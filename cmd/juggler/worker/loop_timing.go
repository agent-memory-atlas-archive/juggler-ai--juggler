// The run() loop is the only consumer of a conversation's inbox, and every
// reply a turn waits on — context, tools, approvals — reaches the turn only
// when the loop dispatches it. A loop that spends long on each event therefore
// shows up far from its cause: as a [roundtrip] reply that took most of
// ContextTimeout "coming back", and as a turn failing with "context/tools
// request timed out" while the engine answered in milliseconds. Each slow
// iteration is logged with what it was handling and how its time divided
// between the event and the reducer pass that follows every event, so the
// backlog behind such a timeout can be attributed rather than inferred.

// slowLoopIteration is the duration at which one run() iteration earns a log
// line: far above a healthy iteration's microseconds-to-milliseconds, and low
// enough that a backlog building towards ContextTimeout is visible long before
// it costs a turn.
