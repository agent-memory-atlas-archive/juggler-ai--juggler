// it waits for is a handful of goroutine handoffs away, so a passing run spends
// none of it, and on a CI box running every package's tests at once under -race,
// losing those goroutines the CPU for several seconds is ordinary.
//
// It is what lets the wake be asserted through the error the turn carries rather
// than through elapsed time. The product's own backstop is the 30-minute
// LLMTimeout, and a stub that waited for it to prove the interrupt never arrived
// would outlast the package's `-timeout 5m`, reporting a killed package with no
// named failure in place of this test.

// the LLMTimeout backstop) and the turn fails with a clear, retryable
// message. Models the real failure: the provider's connection is dropped
