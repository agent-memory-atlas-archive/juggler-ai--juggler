// A stop decides why a task ended, and the spawner's own terminal update always
// lands after it: cancelling the context is what makes the process exit, so
// cmd.Wait returns on a cancelled context and reports "command cancelled" a
// moment after the stop has already recorded who stopped it. The reason a stop
// recorded therefore has to survive the update that the stop itself provoked —
// it is what the user reads on the tool action for as long as the conversation
// lasts, and "command cancelled" names the mechanism rather than the cause.
//
// These drive the registry's ops directly and register no process. What is under
// test is which of two terminal writes the registry keeps, and a real process
// would make the order they arrive in a property of the machine: on a slow
// reaper the stop is read before the update overwrites it and the defect hides.

// registerStoppableShell puts a running task in the registry with no process
// behind it. Cancelling its context is the whole of what signalShellStop can do
// for a task that has not reached cmd.Start, which is exactly this shape.
