// Copying and comparing whole trees, for anything that needs a second copy of a
// project and needs to know what has happened to it since.

// Both walk with the same matcher every other surface here uses, so "the files
// that matter" means the same thing to a copy as it does to glob, grep and the
// file tree — and it means it whether or not git is installed, since the matcher
// reads `.gitignore` itself. That is the whole reason these are operations
// rather than a shell command: `cp` cannot read a `.gitignore`, the pipelines
// that can (`git ls-files | tar`) need git and a POSIX toolchain that agrees
// with the server about absolute paths, and neither is a promise this app can
// make on Windows.
//
// Both ends of both operations are contained: a path that resolves outside the
// scope is refused rather than sanitised, because unlike a write these are not
// gated by the approval flow that would otherwise have asked.
