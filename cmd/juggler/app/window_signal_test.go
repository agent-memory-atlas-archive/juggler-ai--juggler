// The headless server installs its own SIGINT/SIGTERM handling in waitForExit,
// which runs the full teardown — server shutdown, provider subprocesses, the
// project lock — before any native quit. Wails' default handler does none of
// that: signal_handler_desktop.go wires the first signal straight to app.Quit(),
// i.e. [NSApp terminate:], which ends the process without unwinding.
//
// With both handlers armed, one SIGINT reaches both. Terminate wins, because it
// has no work to do, and the process dies wherever teardown had reached — in
// practice partway through stopping the conversation workers, so conversations
// are never closed, provider subprocesses are never reaped, and the project lock
// (released last of all) is stranded until the kernel reclaims the file
// descriptors. The next launch finds the project locked.
//
// Wails must therefore not handle signals for this process.
