/**
 * WorkspaceProviderRegistry - the providers that can make a workspace
 *
 * A workspace provider owns the lifecycle of a place a conversation works in:
 * creating it, reporting on it, finishing with it, and cleaning up after a
 * provision that was interrupted.
 *
 * **Nothing resolves through this registry on the path that matters.** A
 * workspace's kind and root live on the session's own row, so a provider that is
 * disabled, uninstalled, or failing to load cannot strand a conversation bound
 * to a workspace it made. What it can do is leave that workspace without status,
 * without finish actions, and out of the reconcile pass — which is why every
 * caller here asks {@link WorkspaceProviderRegistry#get} and is expected to have
 * an answer for `undefined`, rather than treating a miss as impossible.
 * @augments {BaseRegistry<typeof import('juggler/workspace-provider').default>}
