/**
 * diff-view-prefs — how diffs are drawn, by default.
 *
 * Two preferences: whether a diff opens side by side or as one unified column,
 * and how many unchanged lines it shows around each change. Both are what a
 * NEW diff starts on. Each viewer can then be set on its own, and while it is,
 * it stops following these — see `diff-viewer.js`, which holds that override for
 * as long as the element lives.
 *
 * They belong to the person (the `user` realm, services/prefs.js), beside the
 * bell and the tips they have seen: how you like a diff drawn is a fact about
 * you, and it should hold in every project and every window. Nothing on the
 * server reads either of them — git is asked for a context width per request,
 * and what it is asked for comes from the viewer, not from here.
 * @module utils/diff-view-prefs
