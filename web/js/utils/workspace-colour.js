/**
 * The colour a workspace is known by.
 *
 * Boxes in the tab strip are all the same shape and mostly the same size, and
 * the one thing telling them apart is a name that is often a branch — three of
 * which can share their first twenty characters and all of which ellipsise. A
 * hue is read before a word is, so it is what makes a box findable in a strip
 * of them.
 *
 * Derived from the id rather than stored on the row: it costs no field, no
 * migration and no round trip, it is the same colour in every window and after
 * every reload, and there is no state to go stale. The cost is that two
 * workspaces can land on one hue — which is a nuisance and not a bug, the name
 * being what actually identifies a box.
 *
 * The colours themselves are `--workspace-tint-N` in `css/tokens/theme-dark.css`,
 * one set per theme so a hue keeps its identity and changes only its depth. This
 * file picks a slot and knows nothing about what is in it.
 * @module utils/workspace-colour
 */

/** How many `--workspace-tint-N` the token file defines. Keep the two in step. */
const TINT_COUNT = 8;

/**
 * Which tint a workspace uses.
 *
 * FNV-1a, which is small, has no dependencies and scatters ids that differ in
 * one character — a real consideration here, where ids are generated in a batch
 * and share a prefix. Nothing depends on the exact hash beyond its being stable,
 * so the one thing this must never do is change: every workspace would swap
 * colour on upgrade, which is the whole of what the colour is for.
 * @param {string} workspaceId - The row's id.
 * @returns {string} A CSS value naming one of the theme's tints.
