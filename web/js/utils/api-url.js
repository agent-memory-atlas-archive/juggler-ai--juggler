/**
 * Server URL building — the one rule for addressing this client's server.
 *
 * A server can be reached directly (its own origin root) or mounted under a
 * path by a reverse proxy — the machine server serves each session at
 * `/s/<id>/`. The page that loaded this realm says which: the server templates
 * `window.__jugglerBase` into index.html and engine.html ('' when direct), and
 * the engine worker receives the same value in its start message. Every /api
 * and WebSocket URL is built here from it, so none is written as an absolute
 * `/api/` literal (lint enforces that).
 *
 * A leaf module with no imports, so it is safe in every realm, including the
 * engine worker before its engine graph loads.
 * @module utils/api-url
