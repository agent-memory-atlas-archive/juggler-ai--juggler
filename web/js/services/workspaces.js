/**
 * Writing to the session's workspace table.
 *
 * The table itself is read from {@link Session#workspaces}, which the load fills
 * and every broadcast replaces. This module is the other direction: the calls
 * that put a row there, move it along, and take it away again. They are here
 * rather than on `Session` because the caller is the provisioning host, not the
 * model — a row exists before anything in the browser is bound to it, and often
 * before the thing it describes exists on disk.
 *
 * Nothing here updates {@link Session#workspaces} itself. Every one of these
 * endpoints broadcasts the whole table, and the session's `workspaces-changed`
 * handler applies it — so a client that also wrote the row locally would be
 * holding a second, briefly-different copy of state the server owns. The
 * returned row is the server's answer to this call, for a caller that needs the
 * assigned id immediately; it is not the table.
 * @module services/workspaces

/**
 * Whether a workspace can be worked in.
 *
 * The one place this is decided on the client. It was written out separately at
 * three surfaces — the binding resolver, the composer chip and the new
 * conversation's picker — and they drifted: the picker checked the state and
 * not the root, so a workspace whose tree had been deleted went on being
 * offered as somewhere to start work, described by the error from the request
 * that failed against it. A predicate spelled out at each call site is a
 * predicate that will differ at one of them.
 *
 * It answers the same question as the server's `WorkspaceLookup.Usable`, which
 * stays the authority — this cannot be shared with Go, so the two are kept
 * deliberately alike and the server refuses again for anything that gets past
 * here. What this is for is not offering the user something that will be
 * refused.
 *
 * Both non-ready states refuse every operation, and a root that is not there
 * refuses them just as completely while saying nothing about itself. Absent
 * availability is treated as available: a row from a server that has not
 * answered yet is not evidence of a missing tree.
 * @param {import('../model/session.js').Workspace|null|undefined} workspace - The row, or nothing.
 * @returns {workspace is import('../model/session.js').Workspace} True when
 *   operations against it would be honoured — and, for a caller about to read
 *   the row, that there is a row to read.
