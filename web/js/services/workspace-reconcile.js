/**
 * The once-per-run pass that squares the workspace table with what is on disk.
 *
 * A restart ends every actor while leaving every artifact behind, so the table a
 * session loads describes a world that has moved on: provisions that were
 * running are not running any more, and trees a provider made may have been
 * removed by hand since. Only the browser can settle that — reconciling means
 * asking each provider what it can find, and providers are extensions.
 *
 * But there is no leader among clients, so this runs under the server's claim:
 * the first caller to offer is told yes and every later one is told no. Without
 * it, three open windows would each run `git worktree prune` at each other.
 * @module services/workspace-reconcile

/**
 * Square the table with reality, once per run of the server and once more
 * whenever every window has been closed.
 *
 * Two jobs, in order. First, every row still marked `provisioning` is undone:
 * provisioning is browser-driven, so no provisioner survives either of those
 * moments and such a row is stale **by definition** rather than by any timeout
 * — the second moment is what catches a provision interrupted by a page reload,
 * which no restart ever comes along to clear. Its provider is asked to
 * `cleanupPartial()` it from the checkpoints it left, and the row goes with it.
 * Then each provider is asked to `reconcile()` its remaining rows.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is act on what reconcile reports. Orphans in either
 * direction are returned for the caller to show; removing a tree a user may
 * still want is a decision that belongs to the user, not to a pass that runs
 * unprompted at startup.
 *
 * Rows whose provider is not loaded are left strictly alone — not cleaned, not
 * reconciled, not reported. An extension the user disabled must cost them the
 * provider's features, never the places it made.
 * @param {any} session - The loaded session.
 * @returns {Promise<ReconcilePass>} What this pass did.
