/**
 * Which tree this window's git surfaces are looking at.
 *
 * There are three of them — the status card's counts, the review's file list and
 * one file's diff — and in the Git pin they sit directly on top of one another.
 * They ask three different endpoints through two services that deliberately
 * share no state, so the one thing they cannot be allowed to disagree about is
 * *which tree*: counts from a worktree above a diff from the project would read
 * as a working pin showing the wrong bytes. Hence one answer, held here, that
 * all of them read.
 *
 * The answer is the **visible conversation's** workspace, because a git surface
 * is a window's chrome and a window shows one conversation at a time. It is not
 * per-pin or per-card state: two surfaces open in one window are looking at the
 * same tree by construction, which is also what keeps them on one poll.
 *
 * `''` is the project, which is what every surface showed before workspaces
 * existed, and what an unbound conversation still shows.
 *
 * Only the id travels. The server resolves it, refusing the same four ways every
 * other workspace-addressed request is refused, so a binding that cannot be
 * honoured surfaces as an error rather than as the project's tree wearing the
 * conversation's name.

 * became visible, on its first send.
 *
 * A workspace becoming usable is deliberately NOT one of them. It does not
