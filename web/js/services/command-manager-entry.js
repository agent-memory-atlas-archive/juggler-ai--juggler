/**
 * The two pinned buttons above a command list — "Edit custom slash commands…"
 * and "Browse built-in commands…" — shared by every surface that lists slash
 * commands: the typed-`/` completion menu, the composer's `/` button dropdown,
 * and the mobile actions sheet. The last two also share their command order and
 * row builder from here.
 *
 * That a user can write their own commands is not something a list of commands
 * conveys — `/commands` sitting among them reads as one more command to run, not
 * as the way in. Each surface therefore pins the editor as a button above its
 * list and drops the plain `/commands` row, since the button IS that command:
 * two rows for one action would be worse than none. The second button hands the
 * built-ins to the place that already documents every capability the app loads,
 * so neither list has to be two lists.
