/**
 * Putting back a workspace the table has lost.
 *
 * `session.json` is deliberately disposable here — conversation folders are the
 * truth, and a load rebuilds what it can from them — but the workspace table
 * lives in it. A conversation's binding does not: it lives in the conversation's
 * own document and survives, which leaves conversations bound to ids nothing can
 * resolve, with the trees they worked in still sitting on disk.
 *
 * A binding is an opaque id and nothing else. Nowhere on disk says which tree
 * `ws_k3n8fq2p1` meant, so no sweep can work it out — but the user knows, and
 * the providers can enumerate what exists. So this asks the one question that
 * cannot be answered any other way, and registers the answer UNDER THE STRANDED
 * ID rather than as a new workspace. That is the whole difference between this
 * and adopting a tree from the move dialog: restoring the id brings back every
 * conversation bound to it, including ones nobody has opened, while adopting
 * makes a new row that each of them would have to be moved to by hand.
 *
 * Nothing is re-seeded afterwards. The conversation has not moved — the claim
 * being made is that this is the tree it was already in — and we could only
 * refresh the one in front of us anyway, never the others coming back with it.
 * A recovery that half-refreshes is worse than one that does not.
