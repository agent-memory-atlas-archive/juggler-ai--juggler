 * goes on long enough to be worth explaining — so they are one component here,
 * configured twice.
 *
 * What the configurations differ in is wording and extra lines; what they share
 * is everything with a reason behind it: the scrim, the reveal that reserves its
 * own space so nothing shifts, and above all the rule for what counts as time
 * spent waiting (see {@link LoadingOverlay#_tick}).

 * enough to be worth a word. The block is always laid out and merely invisible,
 * so revealing it moves nothing that was already on screen.
 *
 * Both the grace period and any escalating wording run off time this page spent
 * waiting IN VIEW — not wall-clock elapsed, and not time it spent hidden. Time
 * the page wasn't running at all is excluded by {@link MAX_TICK_MS}; time it was
 * running but hidden is excluded by {@link pageHidden}. Hidden pages matter as
 * much as suspended ones: a browser clamps a background tab's timers to about
 * once a second, which is the tick period, so an unwatched tab accrues the wait
 * at very nearly full speed. Left to count, a two-minute tab switch meant the
 * overlay revealed itself on its last line, having silently burned through the
 * lines that lead up to it. Nothing escalates until the line before it has been
 * on screen, in front of someone, for its full turn.
