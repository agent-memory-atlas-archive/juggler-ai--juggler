/**
 * Whether a conversation dragged somewhere else should really work there.
 *
 * A confirmation, and only that. Where it is going was settled by the gesture
 * that opened this — a tab dropped in another workspace's box, or out of every
 * box onto the flat strip, which is the project folder. Asking again where to
 * go would be asking a question the drag has already answered.
 *
 * What it does ask is worth the pause: a rebinding moves where a conversation's
 * files and commands happen, under an agent that may be working, and an eighth
 * of a second of slipped finger must not do that silently. So it states both
 * ends in full — the tree being left and the tree being moved into, each named
 * and addressed — and waits. Naming one end would confirm nothing; a drag that
 * landed one box off looks exactly like the one that landed right.
 *
 * It is a dialog rather than a block in the transcript because by then the
 * transcript belongs to the work: a conversation half way through a task is not
 * a conversation with a question at the top of it.
 * @module components/workspace-move-dialog
