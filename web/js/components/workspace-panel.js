/**
 * <workspace-panel> — a selected workspace, shown where a conversation would be.
 *
 * A box in the tab strip is selected the way a tab is, and this is what that
 * selection shows: the place itself. What is here is true of the tree rather
 * than of anyone working in it — what it is called, what kind of place it is,
 * where it is on disk, how it is doing, and the ways of finishing with it.
 *
 * It is a panel rather than a menu because that is what these are. A path you
 * may want to copy, a branch and a working state you may want to read twice,
 * and a row of endings that each take something away are not things to hold a
 * pointer still over: they want room, and they want to stay put while they are
 * read. The strip's box is left with only the name on it.
 *
 * What is NOT here is the one thing that belongs to a single conversation:
 * moving one to a different workspace. A workspace of three conversations
 * names none of them, so that lives on the tab.
 * @module components/workspace-panel
