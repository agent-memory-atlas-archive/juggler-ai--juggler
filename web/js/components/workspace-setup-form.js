/**
 * The furniture around a workspace provider's own setup form.
 *
 * A provider renders its fields and answers for them; everything around those
 * fields is the host's — the container, the context they are rendered with, the
 * reporting of every edit, and the line of progress a provision writes while it
 * runs. Two dialogs ask a provider to build something: the one that makes a
 * workspace, and the one that moves a conversation into a place that does not
 * exist yet. This is the one copy of what they share, because two of it is how
 * two views of one flow start looking like two applications.
 *
 * It holds no state. Each caller keeps its own, and passes the values in and
 * takes the edits out.
