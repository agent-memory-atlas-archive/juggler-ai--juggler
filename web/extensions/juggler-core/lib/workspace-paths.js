/**
 * Paths, for a workspace provider that has two path worlds to keep apart.
 *
 * A provider registers roots in the server's own native form and names things to
 * operations relative to a root. On Windows those disagree about what an
 * absolute path even looks like (`C:\src\app` against `/c/src/app` or
 * `/mnt/c/src/app`), and which is right depends on which POSIX toolchain the
 * machine happens to have. So absolute paths are built and compared here, in the
 * separator they arrived in, and what is handed to an operation is relative.
 *
 * Shared by the providers rather than copied into each: two implementations of
 * `relativePath` are two chances to disagree about the one thing neither of them
 * can afford to be wrong about.
