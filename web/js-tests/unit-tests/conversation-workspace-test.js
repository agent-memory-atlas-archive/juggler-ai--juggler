/**
 * A conversation's workspace binding, and the seeds that follow it.
 *
 * A conversation's assistant files are relative to a root: they are whichever
 * tree it works in. That is settled before the conversation exists — the project
 * folder, or the workspace whose box it was started in — so it is bound and
 * seeded at birth and shows what its first turn would carry from the moment it
 * is on screen. What changes the answer afterwards is a move, which rebuilds the
 * seeds out of the tree it moved into.
 *
 * These cases pin that: what a conversation has the instant it is created, what
 * a move does to those seeds and what it leaves alone, that seeding confirms
 * rather than repeats — a seed the user deleted stays deleted — and what a
 * conversation born from another inherits.
 * @module unit-tests/conversation-workspace-test
