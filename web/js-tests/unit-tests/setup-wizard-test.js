/**
 * Unit tests: the first-run setup wizard.
 *
 * The wizard exists because "no providers configured" is a true statement that
 * helps nobody. What it says instead depends on which of several facts about the
 * machine disagree, and the interesting cases are all disagreements:
 *
 *   - The Claude desktop app is installed but the `claude` CLI is not. The app
 *     contains Claude Code as a tab, so the user reasonably believes they have
 *     it; Juggler drives the CLI, which is a separate download. Saying "nothing
 *     found" here reads as a denial of something they can see on their dock.
 *   - The ChatGPT app is installed and signed in, with no Codex CLI anywhere.
 *     That machine is ready to work and must not be told to install anything.
 *   - A CLI is installed but signed out. The fix is a login, not an install.
 *
 * The other assertion worth having is the "check again" button: the whole flow
 * sends people away to install something, and a button that reports the machine
 * as it was when the window opened would tell them their install had failed.
 * @module unit-tests/setup-wizard
