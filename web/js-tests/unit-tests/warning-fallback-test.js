/**
 * What happens to a conversation's warning when there is no composer to put it
 * in.
 *
 * `Conversation.showWarning` is the model's one route to the user, and fourteen
 * callers depend on it — every one of them a refusal the user is owed an
 * explanation for. A conversation reaches it with no composer often enough to
 * matter: one whose tab was never opened, one mid-rebuild, one in a column that
 * hides its input. The warning is genuinely lost in that case, and the point of
 * these tests is that the loss leaves a record: a dropped warning and a warning
 * that was never raised produce identical failure blocks otherwise, which is
 * what made `visible warnings: []` unreadable.
 *
 * The conversations here carry only what `showWarning` reads. Building a real
 * one costs a `session.load()`, a worker spawn and a `/api/providers` fetch,
 * all load-sensitive under the iframe pool and none of them on this path.
 * @module unit-tests/warning-fallback-test
