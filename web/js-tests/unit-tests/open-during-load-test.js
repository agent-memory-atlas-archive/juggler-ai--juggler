/**
 * What an 'open' means depends on whether the first session load has finished,
 * and ConnectionManager cannot read that off `getSession()`: the Session is
 * assigned synchronously and only *then* is its load awaited, so there is a
 * window in which a session exists that cannot yet spawn a worker —
 * `workerManager.init` runs at the END of that load.
 *
 * An 'open' inside that window is not a reconnect, and treating it as one runs
 * the catch-up path against an uninitialised worker manager: every conversation
 * the manifest lists looks new (the load has cleared the map), each is spawned,
 * and each throws "[WorkerManager] Not initialized - call init() first" — so the
 * conversations it was trying to load are lost instead of loaded.
 *
 * The window is not hypothetical. On the juggler.studio remote path
 * `wsService.connect()` adopts an already-open DataChannel and flushes its
 * buffered handoff frames synchronously, so the one-shot 'session' frame and
 * 'open' are emitted in the same stretch: the first starts the load, the second
 * arrives with it still in flight. These cases pin that an 'open' waits for the
 * load rather than racing it, that one load serves every caller who asks, and
 * that a genuine reconnect still catches up.
